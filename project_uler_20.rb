#Lexicographic permuntation-figure out the number of potential sequences
# in a series of numbers
#how to find all different options

#what is the millionth Lexicographic
#millionth is going to be the index of array 999 999...can't call 1 million
#we are giving a set of elements in a aray and calling permutation
#      "test"
#arr = [1, 2, 3]
#then call permutation by typing in  arr.permutation {|i| puts i }
# 1 2 3
# 1 3 2
# 2 1 3
# 2 3 1 
# 3 1 2
# 3 2 1
# it returns a numerator and arrays all different ways you can combine those
#       "test"
